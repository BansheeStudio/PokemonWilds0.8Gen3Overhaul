Thank you for the FR/LG edits, edits to savanna tiles as well as  Deep Desert/Snow tile edits, 
and some of the other tiles in the pack. They really do help blend it and replace some of Hoenn's less detailed tiles 
as well as the optional edits for fans of FR/LG. Also for Porting sounds and music from the gen 3 games.

Thanks for the help with the stressful tiles not fitting & reporting them
as well as the edits you have contributed to the project like the optional bag and menus.

Thanks for the PKMN Sapphire sprite and the permission to recolour it.
It is a great sprite and really fits in well with the game.
